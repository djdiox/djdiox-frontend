          Becoming a DJ has been easier than ever, real disk-jockeys are rare, I
          learned with 2 pioneer CDJ-800 + an old mixer. Today I am using
          technology as well, but only to create more complex levels! I am
          trying to make every gig as unique as my DNA, representing my style
          and beloved Genres like Deep-, Tech-House and Trap. For Private Events
          I let the host decide what to play, or in which direction it should
          go..
